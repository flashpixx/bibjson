                <h2>The purpose of BibJSON</h2>
                <p>BibJSON is a convention for representing bibliographic metadata in JSON; 
                it makes it easy to <strong>share</strong> and <strong>use</strong> bibliographic metadata online.</p>
                <p>It is a form of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> - a simple, useful and common way of representing data on the web; we use it to 
                shift information around between our apps.</p>
                <p>When we want to share with other people, 
                having some conventions about how to use the JSON to do so can be a very useful thing.</p>
                <p>By sharing BibJSON in an agreed manner, we can share data online and use it
                directly in web applications to quickly and easily make better use of our data.</p>
                <p>BibJSON is designed to be <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> above all else.
                It has virtually no requirements, and you could use your own namespaces to extend it. 
                Use it as best fits the purpose of your community.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>A BibJSON record is a JSON object</li>
                <li>A BibJSON collection is a JSON object containing "metadata" followed by "records"</li>
                <li>The "records" key in a collection points to a list of BibJSON records (JSON objects)</li>
                <li>The collection and the records both have the "collection" key, and their value should be the same</li>
                <li>Each record should have a "cid" - an identifier unique within the parent collection</li>
                <li>Each record should have a "type" - such as "article", "book", or even "author"</li>
                <li>Record type places no constraint on what can be placed in the record</li>
                <li>The default set of keys are based on the  
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX">bibtex keys</a></li>
                <li>BibJSON keys are lowercase, no spaces, and usually singular</li>
                <li>The keys can point to strings, lists, or objects</li>
                <li>Any thing that is a simple string should remain so</li>
                <li>Where object complexity is required, make it an object</li>
                <li>Where additional keys are namespaced, include a "namespace" declaration in the collection "metadata"</li>
                <li>BibJSON APIs may return other metadata relevant to the parent app; developers can identify such metadata by prefixing the key with "_"; just ignore what is not useful to you</li>

		<h2>Linked data</h2>
		<p>Rather than re-defining our own methods for representing linked data, 
		we have adopted the JSON-LD linked data specification. This enables representation
		of your data in a BibJSON collection whilst also taking advantage of the power of 
		linked data where necessary, without making the basics of BibJSON overly complex
		for those that do not require it. So in order to represent your data as linked data, 
		just incorporate the <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a> linked data 
		specifications when creating your BibJSON collection.</p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="span8">
		<h2>JSON-LD example</h2>
		<p>We would like to use real world examples as far as possible - do you require 
		linked data functionality within BibJSON? If so, please 
		<a href="mailto:openbiblio-dev@lists.okfn.org">contact us</a>

                <h2>Parsing to BibJSON</h2>
                <p>We have written parsers to BibJSON from a number of popular formats such as bibtex, 
		CSV, RIS, MARC - and we have written BibServer to be easily extensible with additional 
		parsers written in multiple programming languages.  If we do not yet have the parser 
		you require in our repo, get in touch and we will help you write one.</p>
                <p>The parsers are accessible via an API call at 
                <a href="http://bibsoup.net/parse">http://bibsoup.net/parse</a>, so you can send a 
                source URL to it and get it back as BibJSON.</p>
                <p>The parse functionality can be run independently from the core of BibServer,so 
		it is possible to create and expose your own parsers if you wish.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <h2>Schema</h2>
                <p>BibJSON is intended to be simple yet useful, and should be used
                as is most practical. There is no fixed schema as yet, but as JSON-LD is supported 
		it is possible to reference any vocabulary via a namespace declaration and use it 
		with your key/value pairs where necessary.</p>

                Just add .json to the URL or &format=json to

                <p>BibJSON data can be very easily displayed, searched, 
                embedded, merged and shared on the internet via BibServer and similar tools. With that comes the ability to use

                <p>We think that the power of linked data is good where necessary, and we support that via

                <p>We would like to know what you think about BibJSON. We would like to find out where it actually is useful for other people.</p>
                <p>The best place to get in touch is on our mailing list <a href="mailto:openbiblio-dev@lists.okfn.org">openbiblio-dev@lists.okfn.org</a>.</p>
                <p>It would be great to hear back about any potential uses of BibJSON, or any interest in converting records or collections, or in writing parsers 
                to do so. Also, any follow up comments about the conventions described here, or suggestions for additions / changes, should be presented 
                to the mailing list for consideration.</p>
